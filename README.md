### AP Computer Science Principles 
---
*AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer
science. In this course, students will learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply
computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs.
They will incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge.
Students will also explain how computing innovations and computing systems, including the
Internet, work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that
is collaborative and ethical. It is important to note that the AP Computer Science Principles at 
Indio High School will be using the programming language of Python as its designated programming language (CollegeBoard).*

---
### Course
---

**This course is the equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science.  The class will prepare them for the AP Computer Science Principles exam. 
The course provides an overview of computer science.**

The main goals of this introductory, college-level computer science course are:

- **Computational Solution Design** — Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
- **Algorithms and Program Development** — Develop and implement algorithms.
- **Abstraction in Program Development**— Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.
- **Code Analysis** — Evaluate and test algorithms and programs.
- **Computing Innovations** — Investigate computing innovations.
- **Responsible Computing**— Contribute to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.

*AP Computer Science is available to 10th-12th grade students as an elective, or third or fourth year of math credit. 
Meets A-G requirment by providing students credit in the C field if they get a C or better.*

**Prerequisites:**
* Completed Integrated Math 1 with a C- or better both semesters
* Completed Integrated Math 2 with a C- or better both semesters

### Situation
---

Class sizes: 35-45 students
-Class sizes tend to be large which can make it difficult since typically the student population needs a lot more
one on one guidance.  To overcome this hurdle, I try to create a collaborative learning environment in each students are placed in a group either three or four. Students build trust and confidence in each other, which provides them more access to help from their peers.  Lunch time tutoring, After school tutoring, and Saturday School Tutoring is necessary to provide students will adequate opportunities to get indiviualize help on areas in their coursework where they find themselves struggling. 

Student Demographic: 
* 100 % Title 1 (Free and Reduced Lunch)
* 94 % Latino/Hispanic
* 3% African American
* 2% White
* 1% Other
Classroom Technologies: LFD, Projector, One to one chromebook, computer lab.

Indio High School is one of five high schools in the Desert Sands Unified School District.  Each of the comprehensive high school offer specialty
courses that may not be available at other sites.  Indio High School has an innovative Engineering CTE program that would benefit from adding computer science courses into their four year framework. Bridging Computer Science with CTE can be an asset to both programs because it will help to build interest and provide additional rigorous coursework to an already established program.  Currently we have dual enrollment courses with College of the Desert for A+ Certification, but there are no computer science or programing courses offered at our school. The engineering program does introduce limited program knowledge at this time. Our site has seen an increase in students applying to be computer science majors, and students have found the coursework difficult since they are entering college with no previous experience.  AP Computer Science Principles will aid students in their path to becoming college and career ready. 

IHS has an eight period A/B block schedule where classes are 90 min in length.  This schedule creates hurdles for AP teachers because class instruction time is limited and the inconsistency of seeing students every other day hinders students in maintaining class knowledge.  The schedule is in place to aid in offering remediation and the added English Learner classes required by the state while still providing students with room in their schedule for electives.  However, the schedule poses problems for honors and advanced coursework since a great majority of our students are socially economically disadvantaged and need more support in the classroom, teachers struggle to cover designated class standards in the limited instructional hours.  Saturday schools have become necessary to help bridge the gap, but not all students have the ability to attend.

## Plan
--- 
A typical unit will start with a discovery lesson to get students to begin to use critical thinking skills that will aid them in how to approach the given assignments within a unit. This will serve to allow students to develop ideas in the form of thinking maps, flow charts, and other ways to begin to develop the logic structure needed to be successful in Computer Science classes.  Students are used to being taught in an application format and find it difficult to trust their reasoning in situations that are unfamiliar to them. 

Each lesson in the AP classroom begins with video lessons, a flipped classroom approach will be implemented where similar videos are made by the instructor and will be assigned as homework using EdPuzzle in order to have a check for understanding throughout the lessons. Google classroom allows for questions to be given to students and students after submission can read and reply to others in the class.   This allows for students to build academic writing and communication skills as well as the ability to check their or thought process with those in the class.  

The lessons typically proceed with smaller programming tasks. Students will work in their small groups where they will brainstorm approaches to the programming tasks. Additional scaffolding may be needed at the beginning of the activity for those who are struggling to get started, this can be done in a small group teacher lead discussion or by pairing them for a short time with another student to provide them with clarification of their questions. Exercises of sample programs or codes provides students and opportunity to understand how the code works and clarification on the logic needed to produce a certain output.  

At the end of each unit there is a  major programming challenge assignment that is geared toward real-life applications. Building confidence in students is the key to success.  Students will be given a choice to work alone or with a partner at the beginning.  As the year progresses students will inevitably be working alone when they have gained the confidence and ability to tackle the challenge. Ap Classroom has pre-made assessments at the end of each unit, where students can engage in AP style questions. The performance tasks can be used as a class assignment, group assignment and eventually an individual assignment in order to prepare students for the AP exam.

### Application
---

**The course framework includes two essential components (CollegeBoard):**

**1. COMPUTATIONAL THINKING PRACTICES**
The computational thinking practices are central to the study and
practice of computer science. Students should practice and develop
these skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.

**2. COURSE CONTENT**
The course content is organized into big ideas, which are cross-cutting
concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the
course. The content and conceptual understandings within the big ideas
reflect what colleges and universities typically expect students to master
to qualify for college credit and/or placement. 

Teaching Tools:
* Code HS
* Videos
* Jamboard
* Hoovercam
* Overhead projector
* LFD

Collaboration and Communication:
* Google G suite–  Google Doc or Slides
* Kami
* Jamboard

Communication:
Google Classroom will be used daily to post daily lessons. Posts will include information about classwork and homework assignments, due dates and directions on where assigned work will be completed and submitted. Students will be able to send private messages to the teacher.

School email accounts should be checked reguarly by all students in order to receive school-related information and to communicate with teachers and staff. Google Drive will be actively used as the location to maintain school-related files. Students will be expected to create Documents, Sheets, Slides, and collaborate in all these platforms by sharing  with group members in their Google Drive.  Students will also be expected to upload photos or scans of their work to Google Classroom.

The district uses Synergy, to communicate assignments and due dates to both students and parents since it is synced with Google Classroom. Synergy is also avaialable as a tool for email communication with parents, staff, and students. Notes can be made in Synergy to notate contacts made with parents, classroom behavior interventions, and to initiate disciplinary action by sending a referral to administration. 

Homework Policy:
* All Assignments and Due Dates will be posted in Google Clasroom.
Teacher will grade assignments from Google Classroom, and then export grades to Synergy.

Assessments:
Some Assessments will be done on AP Classroom which provides students access and practice with AP questions. 
Google Forms, and Quizziz will also be used. 
Code HS will be used on Performance tasks to create the program, and then Google Doc or Microsoft Word to answer the prompts from College Board.

Grading Policy:
Course Syllabus will provide students with the course description and grading policy.
Students can check scores on Google Classroom or current grades on Synergy.

### Impacts
---
Technology in our world is seen as either an asset or a hindrance in education.  When schools closed in March 2020 it was our only connection to some of our students, and 
quickly we realized the socioeconomic divide in our school. Many of our students did not have access to the internet.  There were areas in the valley that our district MIFI's could not reach.  This was not an issue that was easily solved and even at the start of the 2020/2021 school year we found ourselves in the same situation.  Some students showcased resiliency, while others disappeared from our classes. There was no requirement for cameras or for students to talk in class, we were told due to privacy we could not require these from our students.  And so the muted black screen was our classroom.  After talking with teachers around the country the message was different depending on the school district more than by state.  One thing that stood out was in low socioeconomic areas there tended to be less requirements.  Data suggest in our district that English Language Learners, special education, and students from a low socioeconomic background had the largest learning loss. Currently we are continually evolving course content to meet the needs of our students while still attempting to maintain grade level standards.  Technology has allowed us to be innovative and find ways to meet the needs of all students by using google translate for our online math program to help *all* English Language Learners no matter what their first language.  To overcome many of these challenges it is important to create a safe, supportive and rigorous classroom environment. In order to ensure students have access to internet the classroom will need to be open before school, during lunch, and after school on assigned days.  Students will be able to use this time to work independently or as a tutoring session to gain clarification in areas they are struggling.  In an attempt to ensure students have access at home, it is imparitive we work with district to provide MIFI's to any student registered in this class. 

**Impact** on student learning happens when you make connections with your students and aid them in developing the “math or computer science” confidence they lack.  Technology is a tool that will be there to guide them on their journey and provide them with the skill set needed to be successful after graduation.
