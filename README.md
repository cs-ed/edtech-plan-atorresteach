# Educational Technology Plan
### AP Computer Science Principles 
*AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer
science. In this course, students will learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply
computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs.
They will incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge.
Students will also explain how computing innovations and computing systems, including the
Internet, work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that
is collaborative and ethical. It is important to note that the AP Computer Science Principles at Indio High School 
will be using the programming language of Python as its designated programming language.(CollegeBoard)*

## Context


### Course

**This course is the equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science.  The class will prepare them for the AP Computer Science Principles exam. 
The course provides an overview of computer science.**

The main goals of this introductory, college-level computer science course are:

- **Computational Solution Design** — Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
- **Algorithms and Program Development** — Develop and implement algorithms.
- **Abstraction in Program Development**— Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.
- **Code Analysis** — Evaluate and test algorithms and programs.
- **Computing Innovations** — Investigate computing innovations.
- **Responsible Computing**— Contribute to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.

AP Computer Science is available to 10th-12th grade students as an elective, or third or fourth year of math credit. 
Meets A-G requirment by providing students credit in the C field if they get a C or better.

*Prerequisites:
Completed Integrated Math 1 with a C- or better both semesters
Completed Integrated Math 2 with a C- or better both semesters
