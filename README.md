### AP Computer Science Principles 
---
*AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer
science. In this course, students will learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply
computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs.
They will incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge.
Students will also explain how computing innovations and computing systems, including the
Internet, work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that
is collaborative and ethical. It is important to note that the AP Computer Science Principles at 
Indio High School will be using the programming language of Python as its designated programming language (CollegeBoard).*

---
### Course
---

**This course is the equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science.  The class will prepare them for the AP Computer Science Principles exam. 
The course provides an overview of computer science.**

The main goals of this introductory, college-level computer science course are:

- **Computational Solution Design** — Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
- **Algorithms and Program Development** — Develop and implement algorithms.
- **Abstraction in Program Development**— Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.
- **Code Analysis** — Evaluate and test algorithms and programs.
- **Computing Innovations** — Investigate computing innovations.
- **Responsible Computing**— Contribute to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.

*AP Computer Science is available to 10th-12th grade students as an elective, or third or fourth year of math credit. 
Meets A-G requirment by providing students credit in the C field if they get a C or better.*

**Prerequisites:**
* Completed Integrated Math 1 with a C- or better both semesters
* Completed Integrated Math 2 with a C- or better both semesters

### Situation
---

Class sizes: 35-45 students
-Class sizes tend to be large which can make it difficult since typically the student population needs a lot more
one on one guidance.  To overcome this hurdle, I try to create a collaborative learning environment in each students are placed in a group either three or four. Students build trust and confidence in each other, which provides them more access to help from their peers.

Student Demographic: 
* 100 % Title 1 (Free and Reduced Lunch)
* 94 % Latino/Hispanic
* 3% African American
* 2% White
* 1% Other
Classroom Technologies: LFD, Projector, One to one chromebook, computer lab.

Indio High School is one of five high school in the Desert Sands Unified School District.  Each of the comprehensive high school offer specialty
courses unaviable at other sites.  Indio High School has an innovative Enginneering CTE program that would benefit from adding computer science courses 
into their course load. Bridging it with CTE can be an assett to the program because it will provide additional rigourous coursework.  Currently there are no computer science courses offered at our site and we have seen an increase in students applying to be computer science majors. AP Computer Science Principles will aid students in their path to becoming college and career ready.

* Google G-Suite
* GitHub for e-Portfolios
* codeHS for students IDE's- 
CodeHS is an interactive online learning platform computer science and programming for instruction.  
CodeHS provides online instructional materials supported by remote tutors.

---
### Application
---

**The course framework includes two essential components (CollegeBoard):**

**1. COMPUTATIONAL THINKING PRACTICES**
The computational thinking practices are central to the study and
practice of computer science. Students should practice and develop
these skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.

**2. COURSE CONTENT**
The course content is organized into big ideas, which are cross-cutting
concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the
course. The content and conceptual understandings within the big ideas
reflect what colleges and universities typically expect students to master
to qualify for college credit and/or placement. 

Teaching Tools:
* Code HS
* Videos
* Jamboard
* Hoovercam
* Overhead projector
* LFD

Collaboration and Communication:
* Google G suite–  Google Doc or Slides
* Kami
* Jamboard

Communication:
Students will communicate with teachers using email or through private message on Google Classroom.

Homework Policy:
*All Assignments and Due Dates will be posted in Google Clasroom.
Teacher will grade assignments from Google Classroom, and then export grades to School Loop.

Assessments:
Some Assessments will be done on AP Classroom which provides students access and practice with AP questions. 
Google Forms, and Quizziz will also be used. 
Code HS will be used on Performance tasks to create the program, and then Google Doc or Microsoft Word to answer the prompts from College Board.

Grading Policy:
Course Syllabus will provide students with the course description and grading policy.
Students can check scores on Google Classroom or current grades on Synergy.

### Impacts
---
Technology in our world is seen as either an asset or a hindrance in education.  When schools closed in March 2020 it was our only connection to some of our students, and 
quickly we realized the socioeconomic divide in our school. Many of our students did not have access to the internet.  There were areas in the valley that our district MIFI's could not reach.  This was not an issue that was easily solved and even at the start of the 2020/2021 school year we found ourselves in the same situation.  Some students showcased resiliency, while others disappeared from our classes. There was no requirement for cameras or for students to talk in class, we were told due to privacy we could not require these from our students.  And so the muted black screen was our classroom.  After talking with teachers around the country the message was different depending on the school district more than by state.  One thing that stood out was in low socioeconomic areas there tended to be less requirements.  Data suggest in our district that English Language Learners, special education, and students from a low socioeconomic background had the largest learning loss. Currently we are continually evolving course content to meet the needs of our students while still attempting to maintain grade level standards.  Technology has allowed us to be innovative and find ways to meet the needs of all students by using google translate for our online math program to help *all* English Language Learners no matter what their first language.  To overcome many of these challenges it is important to create a safe, supportive and rigorous classroom environment. **Impact** on student learning happens when you make connections with your students and aid them in developing the “math or computer science” confidence they lack.  Technology is a tool that will be there to guide them on their journey and provide them with the skill set needed to be successful after graduation.
