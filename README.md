# Educational Technology Plan

### AP Computer Science Principles 
*AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer
science. In this course, students will learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply
computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs.
They will incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge.
Students will also explain how computing innovations and computing systems, including the
Internet, work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that
is collaborative and ethical. It is important to note that the AP Computer Science Principles at Indio High School 
will be using the programming language of Python as its designated programming language.(CollegeBoard)*

## Context


### Course

**This course is the equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science.  The class will prepare them for the AP Computer Science Principles exam. 
The course provides an overview of computer science.**

The main goals of this introductory, college-level computer science course are:

- **Computational Solution Design** — Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
- **Algorithms and Program Development** — Develop and implement algorithms.
- **Abstraction in Program Development**— Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.
- **Code Analysis** — Evaluate and test algorithms and programs.
- **Computing Innovations** — Investigate computing innovations.
- **Responsible Computing**— Contribute to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.

AP Computer Science is available to 10th-12th grade students as an elective, or third or fourth year of math credit. 
Meets A-G requirment by providing students credit in the C field if they get a C or better.

**Prerequisites:**
Completed Integrated Math 1 with a C- or better both semesters
Completed Integrated Math 2 with a C- or better both semesters


### Situation

 What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

Class sizes: 35-45 students
Student Demographic: 
* 100 % Title 1 (Free and Reduced Lunch)
* 94 % Latino/Hispanic
* 3% African American
* 2% White
* 1% Other
Classroom Technologies: LFD, Projector, One to one chromebook, computer lab.

Indio High School is one of five high school in the Desert Sands Unified School District.  Each of the comprehensive high school offer specialty
courses unaviable at other sites.  Indio High School has an innovative Enginneering CTE program that would benefit from adding computer science courses 
into their course load. Bridging it with CTE can be an assett to the program because it will provide additional rigourous coursework.  
Currently there are no computer science courses offered at our site and we have seen an increase in students applying to be computer science majors. 
AP Computer Science Principles will aid students in their path to becoming college and career ready. 

## Plan
Instructor Device: 
HP Prodesk
Student Desktop (30 workstations in a computer lab):
with ___" monitor


### Software Specifications

* 35 machines.
* System Model HP Z240 SFF Workstation
* Processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 3408 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)
* Installed Physical Memory (RAM) 16.0 GB
* Storage Size 921.71 GB (989,681,676,288 bytes)

* One to One Chromebooks
* Google Classroom as a learning Management
* GitHub for e-Portfolios
* codeHS for students IDE's


 **CodeHS is an interactive online learning platform computer science and programming for instruction.  CodeHS provides online instructional materials supported by remote tutors.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.
Learning in class

**Teaching Tools:**
* App Inventor
* Videos
*  Jamboard
*  hoovercam
*  overhead projector
*  LFD

**Collaboration and Communication:**
* Google G suite–  Google Doc or Slides
* Kami
* Jamboard

**Communication:**
Students will communicate with teachers using email or through private message on Google Classroom.

**Homework Policy:**
*All Assignments and Due Dates will be posted in Google Clasroom.
Teacher will grade assignments from Google Classroom, and then export grades to School Loop.

Assessments

For quizzes, tests, and final exam, we will use IlluminateEd to create the assessments, and then students can go there to do the assessments, and multiple choice questions will be automatically graded. IlluminateEd is not the best software for entering test questions, it is very tedious; but this is the only testing software that we have.

Sometimes I use Kahoot to give students quick tests. The competition creates some fun.

Assessments – Performance Tasks

Performance Tasks will have to be done using App Inventor to create the program, and then Google Doc or Microsoft Word to answer the prompts from College Board.

Checking Grades

Students can check their grades in SchoolLoop or Naviance (offical posted grades).

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
