# Educational Technology Plan
This Educational Technology Plan is designed to ensure that all aspects of the instruction of AP Computer Science Principles at Golden Valley High School have been explored and planned for. In turn, the plan will help the teacher support their students to success.

## Context


### Course
### AP Computer Science Principles 

AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the foundational concepts of the field 
and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world.  This course is the equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science.  The class will prepare them for the AP Computer Science Principles exam. 
The course provides an overview of computer science. 

Students will:

* Learn to design solutions to problems and evaluate the efficacy of those solutions
* Develop algorithms and programs which include abstraction
* Discover new knowledge using data
* Explain how computing systems and innovations work and explore the potential impacts of those innovations
* Collaborate in a computing culture ethically

AP Computer Science is available to 10th-12th grade students as an elective. 
Meets A-G requirment by providing students credit in the C field if they get a C or better.

*Prerequisites:
Completed Integrated Math 1 with a C- or better both semesters
Completed Integrated Math 2 with a C- or better both semesters


### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
