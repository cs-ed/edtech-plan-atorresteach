# Educational Technology Plan

### AP Computer Science Principles 
*AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer
science. In this course, students will learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply
computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs.
They will incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge.
Students will also explain how computing innovations and computing systems, including the
Internet, work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that
is collaborative and ethical. It is important to note that the AP Computer Science Principles at Indio High School 
will be using the programming language of Python as its designated programming language.(CollegeBoard)*

## Context


### Course

**This course is the equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science.  The class will prepare them for the AP Computer Science Principles exam. 
The course provides an overview of computer science.**

The main goals of this introductory, college-level computer science course are:

- **Computational Solution Design** — Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
- **Algorithms and Program Development** — Develop and implement algorithms.
- **Abstraction in Program Development**— Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.
- **Code Analysis** — Evaluate and test algorithms and programs.
- **Computing Innovations** — Investigate computing innovations.
- **Responsible Computing**— Contribute to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.

AP Computer Science is available to 10th-12th grade students as an elective, or third or fourth year of math credit. 
Meets A-G requirment by providing students credit in the C field if they get a C or better.

**Prerequisites:**
Completed Integrated Math 1 with a C- or better both semesters
Completed Integrated Math 2 with a C- or better both semesters


### Situation

 What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

Class sizes: 35-45 students
Student Demographic: 
* 100 % Title 1 (Free and Reduced Lunch)
* 94 % Latino/Hispanic
* 3% African American
* 2% White
* 1% Other
Classroom Technologies: LFD, Projector, One to one chromebook, computer lab.

Indio High School is one of five high school in the Desert Sands Unified School District.  Each of the comprehensive high school offer specialty
courses unaviable at other sites.  Indio High School has an innovative Enginneering CTE program that would benefit from adding computer science courses 
into their course load. Bridging it with CTE can be an assett to the program because it will provide additional rigourous coursework.  
Currently there are no computer science courses offered at our site and we have seen an increase in students applying to be computer science majors. 
AP Computer Science Principles will aid students in their path to becoming college and career ready. 

## Plan
Instructor Device: 
HP Prodesk
Student Desktop (30 workstations in a computer lab):
with ___" monitor


### Software Specifications

* 35 machines.
* System Model HP Z240 SFF Workstation
* Processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 3408 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)
* Installed Physical Memory (RAM) 16.0 GB
* Storage Size 921.71 GB (989,681,676,288 bytes)

* One to One Chromebooks
* Google Classroom as a learning Management
* GitHub for e-Portfolios
* codeHS for students IDE's


 **CodeHS is an interactive online learning platform computer science and programming for instruction.  CodeHS provides online instructional materials supported by remote tutors.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

The course framework includes two essential components (CollegeBoard):

**1. COMPUTATIONAL THINKING PRACTICES**
The computational thinking practices are central to the study and
practice of computer science. Students should practice and develop
these skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.

**2. COURSE CONTENT**
The course content is organized into big ideas, which are cross-cutting
concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the
course. The content and conceptual understandings within the big ideas
reflect what colleges and universities typically expect students to master
to qualify for college credit and/or placement. 

**Teaching Tools:**
* App Inventor
* Videos
*  Jamboard
*  hoovercam
*  overhead projector
*  LFD

**Collaboration and Communication:**
* Google G suite–  Google Doc or Slides
* Kami
* Jamboard

**Communication:**
Students will communicate with teachers using email or through private message on Google Classroom.

**Homework Policy:**
*All Assignments and Due Dates will be posted in Google Clasroom.
Teacher will grade assignments from Google Classroom, and then export grades to School Loop.

**Assessments:**
Some Assessments will be done on AP Classroom which provides students access and practice with AP questions. 
Google Forms, and Quizziz will also be used. 
Code HS will be used on Performance tasks to create the program, and then Google Doc or Microsoft Word to answer the prompts from College Board.

**Grading Policy:**
Syllabus will provide students with the coursework and grade allocations.
Students can check scores on Google Classroom or current grades on Synergy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.

Technology in our world is seen as either an assett or a hinderance in education.  When schools closed in March 2020 it was our only connection to some of our students, and 
quickly we realized the socioeconoimic divide in our school. Many of our students did not have access to internet.  There were areas in the valley that our district MIFI's could not reach.  This was not an issue that was easily solved and even at the start of the 2020/2021 school year we found ourselved in the same situation.  Some students showcased resiliency, while others disappeared from our classes. There was no requirement for cameras or for students to talk in class, we were told due to privacy we culd not require these from our students.  And so the muted black screen was our classroom.  After talking with teachers aThis round the country the message was different depending on school district more than by state.  One thing that stood out was in low socioeconomic areas there tending to be less requirements.  Data suggest in our district that English Language Learners, special education, and students from a low socioeconomic background had the largest learning loss. Currently we are continually evolving course contexts to meet the needs of our students while still attemping to maintain grade level
